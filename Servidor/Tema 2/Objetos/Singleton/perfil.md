I wonder how type of man is able to publicly enjoy to punish others, using all the power they have trough an unfair and unearned hierarchichal system.

Towards the end of the show, you just realize, that there's nothing else inside him, just a shadow of what he dreamt to be, when he still had dreams.
A shell of a man, a pity to the eyes, a empty casket waiting for his death. No one will come to his funeral, or maybe just to spit on his grave.
