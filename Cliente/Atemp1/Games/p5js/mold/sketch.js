 describe('This sketch simulates behaviors of slime molds. Each slime mold object has position (x and y), traveling direction (r and heading angle) and sensor (in 3 directions: front, left, and forward). As a slime mold moves through the trail, it leaves a trace and the trail map is updated. In each simulation step, a slime mold senses the trail map (the pixel color value) and decides which direction to move and rotate.', LABEL);
