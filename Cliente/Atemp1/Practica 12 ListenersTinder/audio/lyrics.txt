=== The Special Relativity Song ===
===================================

I’m float / ing on a boatAt a constant velocityAnd you’re / On the shoreJust standing there observing me-eeeTo you I’m moving at a speed of vBut you move at minus v, according to meThat’s all / What we callGalilean relativityBut now you better watch itCoz I’m zoomin’ on a rocketAt half the speed of a light beamYou may think that I seeThat the beam’s velocityIs halved, that’s what it might seemBut it’s not!  /  It has gotto move even further-er-errrBecause the speed of lightis the same for every observerrrrrrrrrrr(But how do you get Galilean relativity*and* a constant speed of light?)Einstein knew  /  For this to be trueTime has to slow down for meSo what if / time is relative?Well, that’s!...SPECIAL RELATIVITY(I’m talkin’ about!...)Astronaut fathers younger than their sonsA pole that does and does not fit in a boxE = mc squared... just for funs!These and many other a paradox!Un... locks!With... clocks!Drawn on a spacetime diagramYou’ll see / GeometricallyWhere and when I ammMMMMMMYour friend’s now engagin’Lorentz Transformation:1 over square root of 1 minusv squared over c squaredThat’s the factorFor length contractionAnd time dilationFor a fast! moving! actor!So yeah / That’s the ideaIn its elegant simplicityAnd so / Now you knowThe heart of Special Relativity <3
